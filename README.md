# Takky, an asynchronous image/file attachment gem

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmdeldin/takky.svg)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/jmdeldin/takky)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jmdeldin/takky/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jmdeldin/takky)

Takky aims to make uploading, storing, and processing file attachments
simpler, easier, clearer, and more robust than existing file management
gems. It works best in asynchronous environments using Sidekiq, but it
supports synchronous uploads to Amazon S3 by default.

## Installation

```ruby
gem "takky"
```

```sh
% bundle
```
